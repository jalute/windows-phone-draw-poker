# windows-phone-draw-poker

## Getting Started
This is a Visual Studio 2012 project for Video Poker Jacks or Better for the Windows 7 phone.  VS2012 required a Windows Mobile 7/8 add-in which is obsoleted.  Newer version of Visual Studio (> 2013) will not be able to load this project because of the obsolete plug-in.  The XAML created for this project were done by Microsoft Blend.
